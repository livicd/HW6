    <h3>This map shows the percentage of noninstiutionalized civilians with health insurance in different Georgia counties. The projection is UTM 17N, and the data used is from the 2019 US Census. Counties that are darker purple have a higher percentage of people with health insurance, while counties that are lighter purple have a lower percentage of people with health insurance. Health insurance is associated with more appropriate uses of health services, as well as better public health outcomes. </h3>
